/* Coroutine frame switching for ARMv8 64 bits, this code follows the
 * Procedure Call Standard for the ArmÂ® 64-bit Architecture (AArch64)
 *
 * Registers and their roles:
 *
 *     SP      The Stack Pointer
 *     x30/LR  The Link Register
 *     X29/FP  The Frame Pointer
 *     x19-x28 Callee-saved registers
 *     x18     The Platform Register, if needed; otherwise a temporary register
 *     x17/IP1 The second intra-procedure-call temporary register(can be used
 *             by callveneers and PLT code); at other times may be used as a
 *             temporary register
 *     x16/IP0 The first intra-procedure-call scratch register (can be used by
 *             call veneers and PLT code); at other times may be used as a
 *             temporary register
 *     x9-x15  Temporary registers
 *     x8      Indirect result location register
 *     x0-x7   Parameter/result registers
 *
 * This means that the registers that the callee should save and restore are:
 *   x19-x28, FP, LR and SP
 * Additionally, ARMv8 64 bits ABI makes NEON mandatory and some extra
 * registers must be saved, in particular registers v8-v15 but only the bottom
 * 64 bits.
 *
 * For more information, see:

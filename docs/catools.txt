Overview
--------

The +catools+ library provides three functions for access to EPICS ``process
variables'' over channel access:

+caget(pvs, ...)+::
Returns a single snapshot of the current value of each PV.

+caput(pvs, values, ...)+::
Writes values to one or more PVs.

+camonitor(pvs, callback, ...)+::
Receive notification each time any of the listed PVs changes.

To use these functions a certain amount of setup work is required.  The
following code illustrates a simple application which reads a value from one
PV, writes to another PV, and monitors a third until terminated with
control-C.

----------------------------
# Library version specification required for dls libraris
from pkg_resources import require
require('cothread')

import cothread
from cothread.catools import *

# Using caput: write 1234 into PV1.  Raises exception on failure
caput('PV1', 1234)

# Print out the value reported by PV2.
print caget('PV2')

# Monitor PV3, printing out each update as it is received.
def callback(value):
    print 'callback', value
camonitor('PV3', callback)

# Now run the camonitor process until interrupted by Ctrl-C.
cothread.WaitForQuit()
----------------------------

The following details are general to all cothread applications.

1. The routine +pkg_resources.require()+ must be used to specify a particular
version of the library to use, for example
+
----------------------------
require('cothread==1.6')
----------------------------
+
or if the most recent version is ok then the version number can be omitted as
in the example.

2. Of course, the libraries must be imported.  The +catools+ library is a
sub-module of the +cothread+ library, and can be imported separately.

3. The program must suspend in an event loop of some sort.  The routine
+cothread.WaitForQuit()+ should normally be used, as otherwise the +camonitor+
activity has no opportunity to run before the program exits!

For the latest ``bleeding edge'' (unreleased) version of the cothread library
replace the +require('cothread')+ statement above with the following:

----------------------------
import sys
sys.path.append('/home/mga83/epics/cothread/build/lib.linux-i686-2.4')
----------------------------


Function Reference
------------------

The +catools+ API consists of the three functions +caput+, +caget+ and
+camonitor+.  The functions +caget+ and +camonitor+ return or deliver
``augmented'' values which are documented in more detail in the section
<<Values, Working with Values>> below.


[[Common]]
Common Notes
~~~~~~~~~~~~

All three arguments take an argument +pvs+ which can specify the name of a
single PV or can be a list of PVs.  In all cases the returned result has the
same ``shape'' as the +pvs+ argument, in other words, if +pvs+ is a single
string then a single value (error code, value, or subscription) is returned,
and if +pvs+ is a list then a list of exactly the same length is returned.

In general there are advantages to calling +caput+ or +caget+ on a list of
PVs, as in this case the channel access delays will occur in parallel.

Several arguments are common among at least two functions: +throw+ determines
how errors are handled, +timeout+ determines timeouts, and finally +datatype+,
+format+ and +count+ determine data formats and are documented in <<Augmented,
Augmented Values>>.

+timeout+::
The +timeout+ argument specified how long +caput+ or +caget+ will wait for the
entire operation to complete.  This timeout is in seconds, and can be one of
several formats: a timeout interval in seconds, an absolute deadline (in
+time()+ format) as a single element tuple, or None to specify that no timeout
will occur.  Note that a timeout of 0 will timeout immediately if any waiting
is required.
+
If a timeout occurs then a +Timedout+ exception will be raised unless
+throw=False+ has been set.


+throw+::

This parameter determines the behaviour of +caget+ and +caput+ when an error
occurs.  If +throw=True+ (the default) is set then an exception is raised,
otherwise if +False+ is specified an error code value is returned for each
failing PV.




Functions
~~~~~~~~~

+caput(pvs, values, repeat_value=False, timeout=5, wait=False, throw=True)+::

Writes values to one or more PVs.  If +pvs+ is a single string then +values+
is treated as a single value to be written to the named process variable,
otherwise +pvs+ must be iterable, and unless +repeat_value=True+ is set,
+values+ must also be an iterable of the same length in which case
+values[i]+ is written to +pvs[i]+.  Otherwise, if a single value is given or
if +repeat_value=True+ is specified, +values+ is written to all PVs.
+
The arguments control the behavour of caput as follows:
+
--
+repeat_value+::
When writing a value to a list of PVs ensures that +values+ is treated as a
single value to be written to each PV.

+wait+::
If +wait=True+ is specified then channel access put with callback is
invoked, and the +caput+ operation will wait until the server
acknowledges successful completion before returning.

+timeout+, +throw+::
Documented in <<Common, Common Notes>> above.
--
+
The return value from +caput+ is either a list or a single value, depending on
the shape of +pvs+.  For each PV a +ca_nothing+ success code is
returned on success, otherwise either an exception is raised or an appropriate
error code is returned for each failing PV if +throw=True+ is set.  The return
code can be tested for boolean success, so for example it
is possible to write:
+
----------------------------
if not caput(pv, value, throw=False):
    process caput error
----------------------------




+caget(pvs, timeout=5, datatype=None, format=FORMAT_RAW, count=0, throw=True)+::

Retrieves a value from one or more PVs.  If +pvs+ is a single string then
a single value is returned, otherwise a list of values is returned.  Each
value returned is an <<Augmented, Augmented Value>>, see 
below for details.
+
If +.ok+ is +False+ then the +.errorcode+ field is set to the appropriate
+ECA_+ error code and +str(value)+ will return an error message.
+
The various arguments control the behaviour of +caget+ as follows:
+
--
+datatype+, +format+, +count+::
See documentation for <<Augmented, Augmented Values>> below.

+timeout+, +throw+::
Documented in <<Common, Common Notes>> above.  If a value cannot be retrieved
and +throw=False+ is set then for each failing PV an empty value with +.ok ==
False+ is returned.
--
+
The format of values returned depends on the number of values requested
for each PV.  If only one value is requested then the value is returned
as a scalar, otherwise as a numpy array.




+camonitor(pvs, callback, events=DBE_VALUE, datatype=None, format=FORMAT_RAW, count=0, all_updates=False, notify_disconnect=False)+:: 

Creates a subscription to one or more PVs, returning a subscription
object for each PV.  If a single PV is given then a single subscription
object is returned, otherwise a list of subscriptions is returned.
+
Subscriptions will remain active until the +.close()+ method is called on
the returned subscription object.
+
The precise way in which the callback routine is called on updates
depends on whether +pvs+ is a single name or a list of names.  If it is
single name then it is called as
+
----------------------------
callback(value)
----------------------------
+
for each update.  If +pvs+ is a list of names then each update is
reported as
+
----------------------------
callback(value, index)
----------------------------
+
where +index+ is the position in the original array of PVs of the PV
generating this update.  The values passed to +callback+ are <<Augmented,
Augmented Values>>. 
+
The parameters modify the behaviour as follows:
+
--
+events+::
This identifies the type of update which will be notified.  A
bit-wise or of any the following are possible:

+DBE_VALUE+;;       Notify normal value changes
+DBE_LOG+;;         Notify archive value changes
+DBE_ALARM+;;       Notify alarm state changes

+datatype+, +format+, +count+::
See documentation for <<Augmented, Augmented Values>> below.

+all_updates+::
If this is +True+ then every update received from channel access will
be delivered to the callback, otherwise multiple updates received
between callback queue dispatches will be merged into the most recent
value.

If updates are being merged then the value returned will be
augmented with a field +.update_count+ recording how many updates
occurred on this value.

+notify_disconnect+::
If this is +True+ then IOC disconnect events and channel access
error reports will be reported by calling the callback with a +ca_nothing+
error with +.ok+ False.  By default +False+ these notifications are
suppressed so that only valid values will be passed to the callback routine.
--


[[Values]]
Working with Values
-------------------

There are two types of values returned by catools functions: ``augmented
values'' and ``error codes''.  The +caput+ function only returns an error code
value (which may indicate success), while +caget+ and +camonitor+ will
normally return (or deliver) augmented values, but will return (or deliver) an
error code on failure.

The following fields are common to both types of value.  This means that is is
always safe to test +value.ok+ for a value returned by +caget+ or +caput+ or
deliverd by +camonitor+.

+.ok+::
Set to +True+ if the data is good, +False+ if there was an error.  For
augmented values +.ok+ is always set to +True+.

+.name+::
Name of the pv.


[[Augmented]]
Augmented Values
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Augmented values are normally Python or +numpy+ values with extra fields: the
+.ok+ and +.name+ fields are already mentioned above, and further extra fields
will be present depending on format requested for the data.  As pointed
out above, +.ok+ is always +True+.

Four different types of augmented value are returned: strings, integers,
floating point numbers or arrays, depending on the length of the data
requested -- an array is only used when the data length is >1.

In almost all circumstances an augmented value will behave exactly like a
normal value, but there are a few cases where differences in behaviour are
observed (these are mostly bugs).  If this occurs the augumentation can be
stripped from an augmented value +value+ by writing +\+value+ -- this returns
the underlying value.

The type of augmented values is determined both by parameters passed to
+caget+ and +camonitor+ and by the underlying datatype.  Both of these
functions share parameters +datatype+, +format+ and +count+ which can be used
to force the type of the data returned:


+datatype+::
This controls the format of the data that will be requested.  This
can be any of the following:

1.  +None+ (the default).  In this case the ``native'' datatype provided
    by the channel will be returned.

2.  A +DBR_+ value, one of the following:

+DBR_STRING+;;  Strings are up to 39 characters long -- this is a constraint
set by EPICS.
+DBR_CHAR+, +DBR_SHORT+, +DBR_LONG+;;  These are all signed integer types,
with 8, 16 and 32 bit values respectively.
+DBR_FLOAT+, +DBR_DOUBLE+;; Floating point values with 32 and 64 bit values,
respectively.
+DBR_ENUM+;; A 16 bit unsigned integer value representing an index into an
array of strings.  The associated strings can be retrieved by using
+format=FORMAT_CTRL+ and inspecting the +.enums+ field.


3.  A python type compatible with any of the above values, such as
    +int+, +float+ or +str+.  These correspond to +DBR_LONG+, +DBR_DOUBLE+ and
    +DBR_STRING+ respectively.

4.  Any +numpy+ +dtype+ compatible with any of the above values.

+format+::
This controls how much auxilliary information will be returned with
the retrieved data, and can be one of the following:
+
--
+FORMAT_RAW+ (default)::
The data is returned unaugmented except for the +.name+ and +.ok+ fields.

+FORMAT_TIME+::
The data is augmented by timestamp fields +.timestamp+ and +.raw_stamp+
together with .+alarm+, +.status+ and +.severity+ fields.  The value in
+.timestamp+ is in +time()+ format (seconds in Unix UTC epoch).

+FORMAT_CTRL+::
The data is augmented by channel access ``control'' fields.  

The set of fields returned in +FORMAT_CTRL+ depends on the underlying datatype
as follows:

+DBR_SHORT+, +DBR_CHAR+, +DBR_LONG+;;
The alarm +.status+ and +.severity+ fields together with +.units+
and limit fields:
+.upper_disp_limit+, +.lower_disp_limit+,
+.upper_alarm_limit+, +.lower_alarm_limit+,
+.upper_warning_limit+, +.lower_warning_limit+,
+.upper_ctrl_limit+, +.lower_ctrl_limit+.
The meaning of these fields is determined by channel access.

+DBR_FLOAT+, +DBR_DOUBLE+;;
As above together with a +.precision+ field.

+DBR_ENUM+;;
Alarm +.status+ and +.severity+ fields together with +.enums+, a
list of possible enumeration strings.  The underlying value for an enumeration
will be an index into +.enums+.

+DBR_STRING+;;
+_CTRL+ format is not supported for this field type, and
+FORMAT_TIME+ data is returned instead.
--

+count+::
If specified this can be used to limit the number of waveform points
retrieved from the server, otherwise the entire waveform is always returned.


Fields
^^^^^^
Summary of all available fields in augmented values.

The following fields are present in all augmented values.

+.name+:: Name of record, always present.

+.ok+:: Set to +True+, always present.


The following fields are present in all values if +FORMAT_TIME+ is specified.

+.raw_stamp+:: Record timestamp in raw format as provided by EPICS (but in the
local Unix epoch, not the EPICS epoch).  Is a tuple of the form +(secs, nsec)+
with integer seconds and nanosecond values, provided in case full ns timestamp
precision is required.  

+.timestamp+:: Timestamp in seconds in format compatible with +time.time()+
rounded to the nearest microsecond: for nanosecond precision use +.raw_stamp+
instead.  
+
To compute the timestamp in +datetime+ format, which can be more suitable for
display applications, it can be added to the value by computing
+
------------------
import datetime
value.datetime = datetime.datetime.fromtimestamp(value.timestamp)
------------------


The following fields are present in all values if +FORMAT_TIME+ or
+FORMAT_CTRL+ is specified.

+.severity+:: EPICS alarm severity, normally one of the values listed below.
+
*********************
0:: => No alarm
1:: => Alarm condition, minor severity
2:: => Alarm condition, major severity.
3:: => Invalid value.
*********************

+.status+:: Reason code associated with alarm severity, always present with
+.severity+ code.


The following fields are present in numeric values if +FORMAT_CTRL+ is
specified.  Values of type +DBR_ENUM+ or +DBR_STRING+ are not numeric.

+.units+::  Units for display.  

+.upper_disp_limit+, +.lower_disp_limit+:: Suggested display limits for
numerical values.  

+.upper_alarm_limit+, +.lower_alarm_limit+, +.upper_warning_limit+, +.lower_warning_limit+, +.upper_ctrl_limit+, +.lower_ctrl_limit+:: \
These are all mystery EPICS numeric limits.  If somebody knows what they mean,
please update this documentation accordingly!  

+.precision+:: For floating point values only, the specified display precision
(or 0 if not specified).  Present if value is a floating point type.

The following field is only present in +DBR_ENUM+ values.

+.enums+:: For enumeration values only, an array of enumeration strings.


[[ca_nothing]]
Error Code Values
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Error code values are used to indicate a success return from +caput+ (in
which case +.ok+ is +True+), to indicated disconnection using +camonitor+, and
to indicate any other failure, either as a return value or raised as an
exception.  

All error code values have type +ca_nothing+ and provide the following fields:

+.ok+::
Set to +True+ if the data is good, +False+ if there was an error.  Testing an
error code value for boolean will return the value of +.ok+, so for example it
is possible to write:
+
----------------------------
if not caput(pv, value, throw=False):
    process caput error
----------------------------

+.name+::
Name of the PV which generated this error..

+.errorcode+::
Channel access error code.  The following values are worth noting:

+ECA_SUCCESS+;;  Success error code.  In this case +.ok+ is +True+.

+ECA_DISCONN+;;  Channel disconnected.  This is used by +canotify+ to report
channel disconnect events.

+ECA_TIMEOUT+;;  Channel timed out.  Reported if user specified timeout
ocurred before completion and if +throw=False+ specified.
